# My Rescue USB Setup

Ventoy is an application that creates a Rescue USB that can hold multiple ISO images.

## What I did

1. Downloaded Ventoy, installed it on a 128GB USB
2. Just copied these ISOs straight onto the drive:
   - SystemRescue (my go-to for fixing things)
   - GParted Live (for when partitions get messed up)
   - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (when I need a full desktop)
   - Clonezilla (backup/restore)

## Why these?

- **SystemRescue** - has everything I usually need in one place
- **GParted** - because disk problems always happen at the worst time
- **Ubuntu** - sometimes you just need a normal desktop environment
- **Clonezilla** - learned this the hard way after losing data once

## Notes to self

- Boot with F12 on most machines
- Ventoy shows a menu with all the ISOs
- Can add more ISOs later without reformatting
- Keep this updated every few months
