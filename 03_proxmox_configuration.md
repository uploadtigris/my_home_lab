# Proxmox Configuration

## 1. Reserve Proxmox IP in home router's DHCP settings
- enter IP + port address from Proxmox install into a browser's URL bar (i.e. https://192.168.0.1:####/ as appears on your GUI or terminal)
## 2. Use [Proxmox VE post-install script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=post-pve-install)
- MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS CHECK THE SOURCE OF SCRIPTS!!!
