- 20-50 GB storage for logs

## Basic Installation

### 1. Deploy Wazuh VM on Proxmox

**Option A: OVA Import (Easiest)**

- Import into Proxmox
- Allocate 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM, 50GB disk

**Option B: Docker Container**
- Create Ubuntu LXC container in Proxmox

```

### 2. Install Agents on Monitored Devices

Install Wazuh agent on:
- Your main PC/laptop
