I have a few projects I would like to use as an oppurtunity to learn about various SysAdmin practices.
These include:
- Automated Backups to server
- PFSense Firewall Configuration
- Nextcloud Setup (free Google Drive)
- Wireguard VPN Server
- DNS Sever (Pi-hole + unbound)
- DHCP Server

I will complete these projects mainly on my Ubuntu Desktop running a hypervisor containing a virtual machine (VM) for each service. My goal is to make my tech devices connect seemlessly across iOS, Windows, and Linux.
