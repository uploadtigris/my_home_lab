# Ideas for my home lab

Setup Proxmox on the Thinkpad; good for snapshots & cross platform operations. We will have Proxmox on bare metal, a couple of Ubuntu VMs

Have a Web GUI (uploadtigris.com) with applications that using Route53, route me to different self-hosted services like pi-hole, plex, next-cloud, etc
