#Pi-hole

[Reference](https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/running-pi-hole-on-a-raspberry-pi/)

- Pi-hole is a piece of software that runs on a raspberry pi which acts as a "DNS Sinkhole". 
- Pi-hole sits between you and the DNS server. When you search "google.com", Pi-hole checks if google.com is on a block list, then it queries a real DNS server for the correct IP address.
